						vEpsilon (/ˈɛpsɪlɒn/,[1] UK also /ɛpˈsaɪlən/;[2] uppercase Ε, lowercase ε or lunate ϵ; Greek: έψιλον) is the fifth letter of the Greek alphabet, corresponding phonetically to a mid front unrounded vowel IPA: [e̞] or IPA: [ɛ̝]. In the system of Greek numerals it also has the value five. It was derived from the Phoenician letter He He. Letters that arose from epsilon include the Roman E, Ë and Ɛ, and Cyrillic Е, È, Ё, Є and Э.
						The name of the letter was originally εἶ (Ancient Greek: [êː]), but it was later changed to ἒ ψιλόν (e psilon 'simple e') in the Middle Ages to distinguish theletter from the digraph αι, a former diphthong that had come to be pronounced the same as epsilon.nclude the Roman E, Ë and Ɛ, and Cyrillic Е, È, Ё, Є and Э.
